## Inherits from: [apostrophe-custom-pages](../apostrophe-custom-pages/index.html)
Implement sitewide search for Apostrophe. Provides the
`apostrophe-search` page type for the `/search` page, which
you should include in your "parked pages" if you wish
to have one (see [apostrophe-pages](../apostrophe-pages/index.html)).

Search is powered by the full-text search features of MongoDB.
