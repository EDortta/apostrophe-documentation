## Overview

These methods and API calls relate to the management of files, such as images and office documents. All methods are attached to the `apos` object.

These are lower-level features for those who are not satisfied with simply [including the `slideshow` or `files` widget in editable content areas and singletons](../../tutorials/frontend-development/slideshow-options.html).

### [Server-side methods](server-side.html)

These methods are used to manipulate and access files on the server.

### [Browser-side methods](browser-side.html)

These methods are used to manipulate and access files on the browser.

### [Nunjucks helpers](nunjucks-helpers.html)

These functions are used in Nunjucks page templates to access information about files and construct URLs.

### [Web APIs](web-apis.html)

These URLs are accessed by browser-side JavaScript to manipulate and access files on the server.
