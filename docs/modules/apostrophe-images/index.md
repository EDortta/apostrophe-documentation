## Inherits from: [apostrophe-pieces](../apostrophe-pieces/index.html)
### `apos.images`
A subclass of `apostrophe-pieces`, `apostrophe-images` establishes a library
of uploaded images in formats suitable for use on the web.

Together with [apostrophe-images-widgets](../apostrophe-images-widgets/index.html),
this module provides a simple way to add downloadable PDFs and the like to
a website, and to manage a library of them for reuse.

Each `apostrophe-image` doc has an `attachment` schema field, implemented
by the [apostrophe-attachments](../apostrophe-attachments/index.html) module.


## Methods
### first(*within*, *options*) *[api]*
This method is available as a template helper: apos.images.first

Find the first image attachment referenced within an object that may have attachments
as properties or sub-properties.

For best performance be reasonably specific; don't pass an entire page or piece
object if you can pass page.thumbnail to avoid an exhaustive search, especially
if the page has many joins.

For ease of use, a null or undefined `within` argument is accepted.

Note that this method doesn't actually care if the attachment is part of
an `apostrophe-images` piece or not. It simply checks whether the `group`
property is set to `images`.

Examples:

1. First image in the body area please

apos.images.first(page.body)

2. Must be a GIF

apos.images.first(page.body, { extension: 'gif' })

(Note Apostrophe always uses .jpg for JPEGs.)

OPTIONS:

You may specify `extension` or `extensions` (an array of extensions)
to filter the results.
### all(*within*, *options*) *[api]*
This method is available as a template helper: apos.images.all

Find all image attachments referenced within an object that may have attachments
as properties or sub-properties.

For best performance be reasonably specific; don't pass an entire page or piece
object if you can pass page.thumbnail to avoid an exhaustive search, especially
if the page has many joins.

For ease of use, a null or undefined `within` argument is accepted.

Note that this method doesn't actually care if the attachment is part of
an `apostrophe-images` piece or not. It simply checks whether the `group`
