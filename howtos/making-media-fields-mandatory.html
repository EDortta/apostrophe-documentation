title: Making media fields mandatory
---

When people upload files, it is possible to make the `credit`, `description` and `tags` fields mandatory.

To do so, just configure the `files` option in `app.js`:

```javascript
files: {
  required: [ 'credit', 'tags' ]
}
```

Note that the `title` field is prepopulated with the filename if nothing better is provided.
