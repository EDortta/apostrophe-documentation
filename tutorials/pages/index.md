The `apostrophe-fancy-page` module is designed to extend a regular page, allowing you to add custom properties and functionality without relying on the `apostrophe-snippets` module.

### Should I be using pages or snippets?
Pages and snippets are two different approaches to content in Apostrophe. If you're unsure of which to use, go through this quick checklist:

* **Are you making a type of content that should be managed globally?** If so, you want to take advantage of snippets.
* **Do your pages need to have child pages?** If so, you should use pages. Snippets cannot have subpages.
* **Does your page need to have a permanent url?** If so, you should use pages. Snippets have different URLs depending on where they are used and accessed.
