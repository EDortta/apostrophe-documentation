These HOWTOs cover intermediate frontend development topics: configuring slideshows, detecting empty areas, using LESS stylesheets in your project, that sort of thing. This material builds on what is covered in the [getting started](../getting-started/index.html) arc, so be sure to check there as well for the basics.
